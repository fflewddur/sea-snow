This code powers [isitsnowinginseattle.org](https://isitsnowinginseattle.org). It's a silly site and shouldn't be taken too seriously.

## Weather conditions

Weather conditions are polled from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/). If you'd like to run this code yourself, you'll need [an API key](https://openweathermap.org/api) for current weather data.
